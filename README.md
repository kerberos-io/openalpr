# OpenALPR with Kerberos Vault

This repository was originally created for illustrating the Golang binding delivered by the [Open Source License Plate Recognition project](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr). Currently there are several open issues ([#831](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/issues/831), [#661](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/issues/661)) on the GitHub project asking for support, but unfortunately the project looks deprecated.

Within this repository we will be showing how you can build and containerize the OpenALPR Golang binding, and to integrate it with the [Kerberos Vault](https://github.com/kerberos-io/vault) solution. The goal of this project is that you get a good idea of how you can use OpenALPR (or other algorithms such as [YOLOv3, YOLOv7](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub-objecttracker), etc.) in a production-ready video management deployment.
